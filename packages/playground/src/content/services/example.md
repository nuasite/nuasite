**Speed, precision, and flexibility.**

### Advantages

- Rapid prototyping on scaled samples – verify functionality and design before series production.
- Material flexibility – working with various materials, including environmentally friendly variants.
- Scaled models for presentation – displays, POS materials, and packaging for design approval.
- Dimensional and functional testing – finding the most efficient solutions before production.
- Small batch production or auxiliary assembly materials – ideal for testing individual solutions.
- No shape limitations – our technology enables creation of complex shapes that are difficult to achieve with other methods.

### Technology That Saves Time and Costs

With automated processes and a wide portfolio of materials, we can significantly reduce development time and lower costs for prototypes and test series production.
