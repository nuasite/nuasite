**Edit your site content directly on the page.**

### How it works

- Run your Astro site in dev mode — the CMS overlay loads automatically.
- Click any text, heading, or image on the page.
- Edit the value in the inline panel and hit save.
- Changes are written back to the source file immediately.

### No admin panel

There's no separate dashboard to learn. The editing interface lives on the page itself. Editors see exactly what visitors will see, with editable regions highlighted on hover.

### What you can edit

- Text content and headings
- Image sources and alt text
- Link URLs
- Markdown frontmatter fields in collection entries
