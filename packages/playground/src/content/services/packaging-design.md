**Make your site readable by AI assistants.**

### Generated endpoints

- Every page gets a corresponding `.md` endpoint with clean, structured text.
- A `llms.txt` file indexes all available markdown endpoints.
- A `/.well-known/llm.md` discovery endpoint follows the emerging standard.

### Zero configuration

Add the integration and every page is covered. No per-page setup, no manual content extraction. The integration processes rendered HTML and strips everything that isn't content.

### Why it matters

LLMs, research tools, and AI-powered search increasingly consume web content. Providing structured markdown endpoints means your content works for both humans and machines.
