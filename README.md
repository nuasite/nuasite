# Nua Site open source packages

This repository houses the Astro-first packages that power projects maintained
via [Nua Site](https://www.nuasite.com). Each package is published to npm so
teams can reproduce the same build pipeline locally that Nua Site uses in the
hosted service.

## Packages

| Package | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `@nuasite/nua` | Meta package that pins the versions of Astro, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and the Nua Site tooling used during hosted builds. |
| `@nuasite/core` | Dependency manifest that keeps official Astro integrations (`@astrojs/*`) aligned with the platform. |
| `@nuasite/build` | CLI wrapper around `astro build` that wires in the `@nuasite/agent-summary` integration and prints readable stack traces. |
| `@nuasite/components` | Reusable Astro components (currently the Nua Site form widget) with TypeScript-friendly props. |
| `@nuasite/agent-summary` | Astro integration that produces `AGENTS.md`, a machine-readable catalog of every generated page. |
| `packages/playground` | Example Astro project used to manually test the packages in this repo. |

## Getting started

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.com) ≥ 1.0.
2. Install dependencies from the repo root:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Run the Bun/NPM workspace scripts you need:

   - `bun run lint` / `bun run lint:fix` – Biome linting.
   - `bun run format` / `bun run format:check` – dprint formatting.
   - `bun test` – Executes the packages' Bun test suites.
   - `bun run ts:build` – Type-checks the TypeScript projects.

Use `bun workspace <package> run <command>` (or `bunx` with the binary path)
whenever a package exposes its own scripts.

## Working on a package

Each package keeps its sources in `packages/<name>/src` and may publish
generated files to `packages/<name>/dist`. The repo is managed as a single Bun
workspace, so cross-package changes can be made in one PR. A few tips:

- Use `bun run clean` if you need to reset local `dist/` and `node_modules/`.
- The playground project (`packages/playground`) can be linked against local
  packages to test them inside a real Astro site.
- `scripts/tag-version/run.sh` is a helper used by maintainers when cutting
  releases; most contributors will not need it.

## Feedback & contributions

Bug fixes and improvements are welcome. If you need help or have feature
requests for the hosted service, visit [Nua Site](https://www.nuasite.com) or
open an issue in this repository so we can triage it with the team.
